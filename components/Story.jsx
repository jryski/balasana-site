            I hit a wall I didn't see coming. Not a gentle "I need a vacation" wall—the kind where you wake up exhausted after 8 hours of sleep. Where you stare at your to-do list and feel nothing but dread. Where you snap at the people you love most because you have nothing left to give.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I was overloaded. Burned out. Running on fumes.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            The worst part? Everyone kept telling me this was just "part of being a parent." But this wasn't normal tired. This was lying-awake-at-3am-despite-being-exhausted tired.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I knew something had to change. I refused to accept that this was just how life had to be.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            I started researching—really researching. Not just Googling "supplements for energy," but diving into clinical studies, learning about neurotransmitters, stress hormones, and circadian rhythms. I discovered that what I was experiencing had names: chronic stress, cognitive fatigue, HPA axis dysregulation.
          </p>
          
          <div className="bg-[#E8F5F3] border-l-4 border-[#2A9D8F] p-6 my-8 italic text-xl">
            "Your brain doesn't work the same way at 7am and 7pm."
          </div>
          
          <p>
            In the morning, you need support for focus, clarity, and mental energy. In the evening, you need support for recovery, memory consolidation, and restorative sleep. Yet every supplement I found treated my brain like it was the same all day. One formula. One approach.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            That's when I realized: <strong>Nobody had built what I actually needed.</strong>
          </p>
          
          <p>
            Balasana started as a dream to create wellness apparel—the name itself, Sanskrit for "child's pose," represented our commitment to finding equilibrium. But as we researched and spoke with customers, we realized something fundamental:
          </p>
          
          <p className="font-semibold text-[#1A2332]">
            True balance doesn't start with what you wear. It starts with what fuels you from within.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            So I decided to create what should have existed all along: A circadian nootropic system built for real people dealing with real stress. Not marketing doses. Not proprietary blends hiding insufficient ingredients. Clinical-grade formulas with transparent dosing and actual efficacy.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            But that was just the beginning. Because burnout isn't solved by supplements alone. It requires a complete approach—nutrition, movement, recovery, and mindset. A complete lifestyle ecosystem.
